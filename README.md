# ðŸ’€ erabytse-tomb  
*A respectful cemetery for dead links â€” not deletion, but remembrance.*

> "When a link dies, we do not erase it. We remember what it carried."

## ðŸŒ¿ Philosophy
- Dead links are **not failures** â€” they are **traces of a living web**.  
- We **honor** what is lost, and **preserve** what can be saved.  
- Every tomb is a **memorial**, not a grave.

## âœ¨ Features (v0.1)
- Scans Markdown, HTML, or text files for links  
- Checks if links are alive  
- Searches [archive.org](https://archive.org) for lost pages  
- Generates:
  - `tomb_report.json` (structured data)
  - `tomb.html` (human-readable memorial page)
- **No automatic replacement** â€” you decide what to do next

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

pip install erabytse-tomb
erabytse-tomb --file ./my_blog.md --dry-run
* A tomb.html memorial page and tomb_report.json will be saved in the same directory.
  No link is modified in your original file â€” you decide what to do next.
